	<div class="home main">
		<h1 class="page-title">This is the home page</h1>
		<p>
			I think there should be a carousel of stock images here until we can get
			our own.
		</p>
		<p>
			The build mini-app should be right below the heading below the carousel.
		</p>
		<p>
			Contact form right at the bottom and also on the <i>Contact Us</i> page.
		</p>
		<p>Sitemap and stuff in the footer.c</p>
		<p>
			This is where you'll be able to design all your own systems or choose to
			contact us to put a custom build together for you.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let us take care of purchasing equipment, scheduling delivery, pulling a
			permit, installation, commissioning, etc. All you have to do is select
			what you want and schedule a time for us to get to work!
